My coding education started with the Coding Dojo bootcamp and has continued through online courses found on Youtube and Udemy; along with building my own projects, independent research, and problem-solving. My learning goal for 2022 is to master JavaScript and React, my bonus goal is to master the MERN Stack. I have chosen to learn the MERN Stack first because of the functionality and versatility it offered for web apps, mobile apps, and cloud-based apps.

I've always wanted a career doing something that I loved. Over the years what I love has changed, but overall I've noticed an underlying trend; a deep passion for helping others achieve their goals. It was present in every professional discipline I pursued such as animal training, health and fitness encouragement, as well as providing advice to peers, and it showed up again when I found myself helping the students I worked with.

It's also present in coding and the problems I can help others solve. From building custom websites to online stores, engineering business managment tools; even creating educational platforms to make learning more fun for kids and so much more. Helping others achieve their dreams and goals is very meaningful to me, with coding I can build something to help not only today, but for many years to come.
