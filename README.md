 My background as a full-stack developer expanded during my time at the Coding Dojo bootcamp where I had the opportunity to dive into JavaScript using React and complete two full-stack projects. I was excited to learn MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) full-stack because I saw the functionality and versatility  it offered web apps, mobile apps, and cloud based apps. It ranks high in desired stacks, so I found it to be a good foundation and starting point for my web development career and journey.
 
For our group project my partner and I built a Training Web Application which allows coaches to create training routines and programs for specific sports disciplines. Users can select their training routine with current goals in mind and track their completion progress. 

My solo project is a Business Manager Web Application that helps businesses track their product inventory and work orders. Each business adds their own products and work orders, the application keeps track of inventory and stock. As work orders are created and updated the individual products stock inventory is also updated.

Since graduation I have continued to work on both of these projects to further build and improve their functionality. I chose Business Manager to help my family run their model train business, and my partner and I have a shared interest in rock climbing and outdoor sports so we decided to create a program to help others in training for their adventures.

A little about me, I’m a single mom, currently homeschooling my son. In my free time I train and compete in jiu-jitsu, rock climb, backpack and participate in all things outdoors. I appreciate the mental and physical challenges each presents. The perseverance, attention to detail, creative problem solving skills, risk management and high stress tolerance that each one demands; challenges me to open my mind and see things in a different light. I enjoy both the challenges and rewards, overall loving the journey and adventures of each one.

Ever since I was a child I’ve wanted to be my own boss doing something that I loved. Over the years what I love has changed, but overall I’ve noticed an underlying trend; a deep passion for helping others achieve their goals. It was present in my pursuits of animal training. In the health and fitness encouragement and advice offered to friends and family, and in my approaches to help the students I work with. It’s also present in coding, and the problems that I can help others solve. Helping others achieve their individual goals is meaningful to me.
